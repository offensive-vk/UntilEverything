## Languages and Frameworks

- [Ajax](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Ajax/) (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques used to create asynchronous web applications by sending and receiving data from a web server without reloading the entire page.
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Bootstrap/) is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
- [CSS](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/CSS/) stands for Cascading Style Sheets, used to style the layout and appearance of web pages.
- [Express](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Express/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, commonly used for creating APIs and web servers.
- [HTML](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/HTML/) stands for HyperText Markup Language, used to create and structure content on web pages.
- [jQuery](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/jQuery/) is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies various tasks like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions for web development.
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/JavaScript/) is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- [Markdown](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Markdown/) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in inline forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
- [MDX](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Markdown/) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax, often used to format readme files, documentation, and notes, commonly supported in platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow.
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/MongoDB/) is a NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model to store data in flexible, JSON-like documents, commonly used for scalable, high-performance applications.
- [Node JS](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Node/) is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side, outside of a web browser.
- [PHP](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/PHP/) is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- [Python](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Python/) is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and versatility.
- [React](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/React/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making the code easier to manage and develop.
- [Sass](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/CSS/Sass/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/TypeScript/) is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale JavaScript applications.
- [YAML](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/YAML/) (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange. It uses indentation to represent data structures and is often used in applications where data needs to be easily readable by humans as well as machines.
