- [MongoDB](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/MongoDB/) is a NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model to store data in flexible, JSON-like documents, commonly used for scalable, high-performance applications.
- [Node JS](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Node/) is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side, outside of a web browser.
- [PHP](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/PHP/) is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- [Python](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/Python/) is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and versatility.
- [Sass](https://github.com/offensive-vk/UntilEverything/blob/master/CSS/Sass/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
