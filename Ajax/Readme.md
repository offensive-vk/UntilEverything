# **What is AJAX** ?

Ajax short for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" or "Asynchronous JavaScript transfer  is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of `XML`.

Ajax is not a technology, but rather a programming concept. `HTML and CSS` can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage can be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display and allow the user to interact with the new information. The built-in `XMLHttpRequest` object is used to execute Ajax on webpages, allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, nor is it a new language. Instead, it is existing technologies used in a new way.
