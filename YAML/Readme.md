# **What is YAML** ?

**YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange. It uses indentation to represent data structures and is often used in applications where data needs to be easily readable by humans as well as machines.

- Filename extensions - .yaml, .yml
- Internet media type - application/yaml
- Initial release - 11 May 2001; 22 years ago
- Type of format - Data interchange
- Open format? - Yes
- Official Website - <https://yaml.org>

YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax that intentionally differs from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). It uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting and does not require quotes around most string values (it also supports JSON style [...] for lists and {...} mixed in the same file).

## Points to be noted : 

- YAML is CASE sensitive
- YAML does not allow the use of tabs
- Must be space between the element parts
- YAML is a superset of JSON
- YAML is the only language used in Github Actions. To automate your workflows.
